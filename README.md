# Pasukon
Pasukon generates parsers based on a relatively easy to learn grammar. It's
based on parser combinators, and also implements a lexing step.

It is highly extensible (you can make your own lexer and combinators), has no
external dependencies, and works in both Node.js and Browser.

# Install

    npm install -g pasukon

# Usage
You can use Pasukon in several ways. The easiest is to give it a grammar as a
string and let it do it's thing:

```javascript
const Pasukon = require('pasukon')
const parser = new Pasukon(fs.readFileSync('my-grammar.pasukon').toString())
parser.parse('hello, world!')
```

To get the most out of Pasukon, though, you can pre-compile the grammar to
enable optimizations:

    pasukon my-grammar.pasukon grammar.js

Then you can do:

```javascript
const grammar = require('grammar')
const Pasukon = require('pasukon')
const parser = new Pasukon(grammar)
parser.parse('hello, world!')
```

## Browser Usage
If you are just using a browser, you can use the
[distributable](https://github.com/gosukiwi/Pasukon/tree/master/dist) build:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="pasukon.dist.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="grammar.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  // `Pasukon` and `grammar` are globals defined in `pasukon.dist.js` and
  // `grammar.js` respectively
  const pasukon = new Pasukon(grammar)
  pasukon.parse('my input')
</script>
```

For anything but trivial usage, it's recommended to use Pasukon with a module
system. The most popular options at the moment are
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/).

## Options
You can optionally pass `Pasukon` an options object:

* `lexer`: An instance of a Lexer to be used by the parser. Default: `undefined`. If none specified, it will use the built-in lexer in the grammar.
* `cache`: Boolean. Default: `false`. When `true`, it will cache the parsers results.
* `start`: String. Default: `null`. When given, it will start the parsing process from the specified rule.
* `debug`: Boolean. Default: `false`. When `true`, it will use the logger to log each parsing step.
* `logger`: Default: `null`. If specified, it will use this logger when debugging. A logger only needs a `log(string)` method.

```javascript
const result = new Pasukon(grammar, { cache: true, start: 'some-rule' }).parse('input')
```

# Syntax
Pasukon syntax is rather simple. It's divided in two parts: Lexing and Parsing.

## Lexing
Optionally, you can define a lexer inside a `lex`-`/lex` block. In the format
`[match|ignore] <token-name> <matcher>`.

```
lex
  match  DEF        'def'
  match  IDENTIFIER /^[a-zA-Z]/
  match  NEWLINE    /^\n/
  ignore WHITESPACE /^[ \t\r]+/
/lex
```

It supports two different matchers, the first one is just a string comparison.
The second uses regex, and matches the input against it. It returns true only
if the input starts with the given regex, that is, it has matched and the index
is 0.

For performance reason, it's a good idea to start all regexes with `^` so the
regex engine can stop as soon as possible.

For more complex lexers, you can build your own. All it needs is an object that
implements `*lex(input)` and returns an array of `Token`.

Notice that `*lex` is a generator function that uses `yield` to return tokens in
a lazy way.

The `Token` value object class lives in `lib/lexer/token`. It implements an `is`
method (eg: `token.is('NEWLINE')`), as well as `col` and `row` properties. You
can use your own `Token` implementation or the one provided by this library.

## Parsing
The parsing part of the grammar is simply a set or rules:

```
<rule-name>
  | <rule-body>
  | <another-rule-body>
  ;
```

Each rule returns a parser, which can be used by other rules and combinators.
You can use the built-in `token` parser to match a single token:

```
program
  | token a
  ;
```

That will make a new parser, called `program`, that will call the `token`
built-in parser with the argument `a`. Now the `program` parser will match a
single instance of the token `a`.

The token parser is special, because it uses tokens as parameters, instead of
other parsers.

There are three ways of calling parsers. _Unary Call_:

```
program
  | many0 (token a)
  ;
```

_Binary Call_:

```
program
  | (token a) or (token b)
  ;
```

And _Rule Call_:

```
start
  | another-rule
  ;
```

A rule can be composed of any combination of those methods:

```
program
  | many0 ((token a) or (token b))
  | (token a) or ((token b) or (token c))
  ;
```

Notice that no matter how nested it is, an outmost rule is always either in
__unary__, __binary__, or __rule call__ format.

Another important thing to note is the use parentheses. Binary combinators all
have the same priority so they are always executed from left to right:

```
program
  | (token a) or (token b) or (token c)
  // is the same as
  | (token a) or ((token b) or (token c))
  ;
```

If you need to change the priority, simply use parentheses. It's recommended to
always use them in non-trivial rules to make things clear.

## Syntactic Sugar üç¨
The grammar syntax provides some sugar üç¨ to make things easier. The most common
is `|`:

```
program
  | (token a) or (token b)
  ;
// is the same as
program
  | token a
  | token b
  ;
```

Also, most built-in unary parsers have a _shortcut syntax_. For example, you can
use `:` to use the token parser:

```
program
  | :a
  | :b
  ;
```

The shortcut syntax has high priority, so it can go anywhere and there's no need
for parentheses:

```
program
  | opt :a // this is a unary call to the `opt` parser
  | opt token a // this is a binary call to the `token` parser, which is not what we want, and is invalid
  ;
```

Below are all the unary parsers shortcuts:

* `*` for `many0`
* `+` for `many1`
* `?` for `opt`
* `:` for `token`

Putting it all together:

```
statement
  | :A then ?(:B or :C)
  | :D
  ;

statements
  | *statement
  ;
```

The last rule will be considered the __starting rule__.

## Evaluating Code
Rules can optionally evaluate some code:

```
statement
  | :A then ?(:B or :C) 'return { type: 'FOO', first: $1, second: $2 }'
  | :D
  ;
```

Only the outermost call evaluates the code. Binary calls populate two variables:
`$1` and `$2`, which is the match of the left hand side and right hand side
respectively. Unary or rule calls only populate `$1`.

You can build up complex results from simple ones as such:

```
name
  | many0 (:A or :B) 'return { type: "NAME", value: $1.join("") }'
  ;

statement
  | name then :C 'return { type: "STATEMENT", name: $1, c: $2 }'
  ;
```

### Named Parameters
To make things easier to manage, you can use the special `as` combinator, which
takes a parser on the left hand side, and a token on the right hand side. Then
it will give you access to a variable of the same name when evaluating code. You
can access it using `$.<my-name>`:

```
statement
  | (*(:A or :B) as :demo) then :C 'return { type: "STATEMENT", name: $.demo.join(""), c: $2 }'
  ;
```

### Using The Context
You can add to the context in which the code in grammars get evaluated.

```
Evaluator.setContext({ foo: function () { return 2 } })
const result = new Pasukon('grammar.g').parse('input')
```

You can then access the context using `$ctx`:

```
name
  | :A 'return $ctx.foo($1)'
  ;
```

The rule above will return `2` if it matches, because `$.foo` returns `2`. This
is useful for building up AST nodes.

Note that this __wont play nice with caching__ though, as the result of each
parsing step is saved, so the code is executed only once. This might lead to
some unexpected behavior.

# Available Combinators
Unary combinators: `many0`; `many1`; `opt` and `identity`.

Binary combinators: `then`; `or`.

# Adding Your Own
You can add your own combinators as such:

```javascript
const Parser = require('pasukon').Parser
const parser = new Parser(definitions)
parser.addUnaryCombinator('combinatorName', MyCombinatorClass)
parser.addBinaryCombinator('otherName', SomeBinaryCombinator)
```

TODO: Make this easier to do, shouldn't need to know the internals.

Unary combinators take a single argument, a parser, in the constructor. Binary
combinators take an array of two parsers.

They must implement a `parse` method and return a `Result` object. You can see
example combinators in `./lib/parsers/combinators`.

## Left Recursion
You have to be careful when defining rules that they are not left-recursive.
That means, a rule cannot match itself first. It needs to match other things
first.

```
// left recursion infinite loop
start
  | start
  ;

// this is fine
start
  | :a start
  ;
```

It also applies to rules that call other rules.

```
// left recursion infinite loop
// because `RULE_B` starts with `RULE_A` and `RULE_A` starts with `RULE_B`
RULE_A
  | RULE_B
  ;

RULE_B
  | RULE_A
  ;
```

The parser will check for left-recursion and fail if it can find it.

## Operator Precedence
Say you want to match `+`, `-` first, then `*` and `/`. Here's an example on how
to do it:

```
TODO
```

# Writing Efficient Parsers
Each rule is executed from left to right, from top to bottom. If a particular
branch fails, it retries from the beginning on another branch. Eg:

```
demo
  | (many0 :a) then :b
  | (many0 :a) then :c
  ;
```

For the input `aaaac`, the parser will match four `a` tokens, then try `b`.
Because it finds a `c` instead, it goes back all the way, scans four `a` again,
then scans `c` and succeeds.

A more efficient parser would be:

```
demo
  | (many0 :a) then (:b or :c)
  ;
```

Alternatively:

```
demo
  | (many0 :a) then tail
  ;

tail
  | :b
  | :c
  ;
```

Yet another alternative is enabling __caching__. Simply pass `{ cache: true }`
to the options and `(many0 :a)` will be evaluated only once (in the first
example).

Note that memoization uses up more memory, and has the extra step of
saving/checking each parse step. It's up to you whether you want to use it or
not.

Luckly, it's very easy to toggle so once your grammar is done, try
enabling/disabling it and see if you get any performance benefits.

# Why
Pasukon is designed to be simple to learn, use and extend. Inspired by the
awesome [PEGjs](https://pegjs.org), I decided to create a similar parser
generator that can handle caching + indent-based grammars by implementing a
lexing step.

Pasukon's grammar syntax is quite simplistic, it provides a few rules and
everything is built upon that. There's no left-recursion elimination or operator
precedence. Instead, you need to define rules in the proper order (like PEG
parsers).
